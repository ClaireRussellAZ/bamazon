Overview:
Bamazon utilizes both MySql and node modules to take orders from the client and deplete stock from my store accordingly.

The App:

The client can view the item, price of item, and the amount in stock.
Acessing the database, we can enter the product id connected thru the local server (named amazonjava.js on my files).
The node server will pick up on the info from mySQL and show the info for each product
